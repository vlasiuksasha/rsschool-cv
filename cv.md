### _Briefly About Myself_
In 2018, I entered the _National University by Karazin_. It was a dream to study law.
But after a few years I realized that it was not mine. The lawyer's work turned out to be boring and uninteresting.
I started looking for something new for myself. In the summer of 2021, I accidentally found a webinar on website development. The webinar itself was short, but I learned the basics _HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP_.

After that, I started looking for new courses to gain additional knowledge while studying at university.
So I got acquainted with the following courses: _MateAcademy, HtmlAcademy, Hexlet_.
This is not the end of my studies, I try to improve my knowledge even more every day.
The only thing that struck me at the beginning was that I have no technical education, but now it is not a problem for me.

__I think that I am a very motivated and enduring person, because every day I get closer to my goal - to find a dream job so that it brings pleasure__.
